== Description ==

Do you want to gain insights about which version of your website’s page layout works best among the visitors, which can lead to higher conversion rates? A simple A/B testing experiment is what you are looking for and this plugin provides just that.

The plugin helps you to create 2 or more versions of any of your wordpress website pages. You can decide how many % of visitors should see one version and how many % of visitors should see the alternative version. Then the plugin automatically splits the traffic to this page according to percentage set for each version.

For each version you can see the analytics e.g. how many users have interacted with the web page - this will help you measure the engagement for each version and ultimately decide which version of the web page performs the best.
